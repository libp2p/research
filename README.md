## What's in This Repo?

This repo contains all exploratory research work and prototyping for inclusion in IPFS.  

**Disclaimer:** While we work hard to document our work as it progresses, research progress may not be fully reflected here for some time, or may be worked out out-of-band.

## Key Open Problems

We break down a few of the Key Open Problems of high priority for the project in this repo. Some have open [RFPs](https://github.com/protocol/research-rfps#rfps-and-grants). For all, we welcome any collaborations (potentially leading to new constructions, discoveries and publications). Please reach out at research@protocol.ai.

## Funding

[Protocol Labs runs an RFP(Request For Proposals)](https://github.com/protocol/research-rfps) Program with the goal to fund individuals and groups to come up with novel solutions to the Open Problems found in this repo.
